## Problems?
If you are having issues with the bot, please do not open an issue here.  Go to [the Now Live Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/kcWshbIU/a94c145e598be9f8dd734197ba07288e/now-live-bot) and let the developers know first.  If it's a big enough issue, we'll tell you to open an issue here.  If any issues are opened up here without bringing it up on Trello first, they will be automatically closed and not actioned upon.
